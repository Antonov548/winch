# winch

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of winch is to provide stack traces that combine R and C function calls.


## Installation

Once on CRAN, you can install the released version of winch from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("winch")
```

## Example

This is an example where an R function calls into C which calls back into R:

```{r example}
library(winch)

foo <- function() {
  winch_call(bar)
}

bar <- function() {
  winch_trace_back()
}

foo()
```
